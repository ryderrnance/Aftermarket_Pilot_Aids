# Aftermarket_Pilot_Aids

# Product Mission
Our goal is to create a feature for older planes to enhance their safety feautures to recognizes if the planes system has deviations in altitude, directions, and any other data pilots then to analyzes while directing a plane. The user will ideally interface with an app or webpage that will analyze the planes progress throughout it's journey and also uses voice recognition to monitor the conversation between the pilot and the control tower operator so it will already know if any deviation was meant purposely or due to error.
